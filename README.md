# A minimal Astro site with Sanity Studio

This starter uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) for the front end and [Sanity](https://sanity.io/) to handle its content.

## Featuring

- How to fetch content as data from [the Sanity Content Lake](https://www.sanity.io/docs/datastore)
- How to render block content with [Portable Text](https://www.sanity.io/docs/presenting-block-text)
- A [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-studio) to create and edit content
- How to crop and render images with [Sanity Image URLs]Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16.12 or later)
- [Sanity CLI](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli) (optional)

## Getting started

The following commands are meant to be run in **both** the `/app` and `/studio` folders.

1. `npm install` to install dependencies
2. `npm create sanity@latest init --env`, this will:

   - ask you to select or create a Sanity project and dataset
   - output a `.env` file with appropriate variables
   - _(or use `sanity init --env` if you have the CLI installed)_

3. `npm run dev` to start the development server

Your Astro app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and Studio on [http://localhost:3333/](http://localhost:3333/).

_Feel free to move each of the folders to dedicated locations and check them into version control._

### Add content

1. Visit the Studio and create and publish a new `Post` document
2. Visit the App and refresh the page to see your content rendered on the page

The schema for the `Post` document is defined in the `/studio/schemas` folder. You can add more documents and schemas to the Studio to suit your needs.

## Removing TypeScript

If you do not wish to use TypeScript, we've included a `remove-typescript.mjs` file in the root of this repository. You can run this file with `node remove-typescript.mjs` to strip all types from both the `/app` and `/studio` folders. Please run this before tampering with any code to ensure that all types are properly removed.

If you intend to use TypeScript, you can safely remove the `remove-typescript.mjs` file.

## Deployments

The `/app` and `/studio` folders are meant to be deployed separately.

Feel free to deploy the App to whichever hosting provider you prefer. We recommend [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

You can deploy the Sanity Studio by running `sanity deploy` in the `/studio` repository, provided you have the `@sanity/cli` installed globally.
